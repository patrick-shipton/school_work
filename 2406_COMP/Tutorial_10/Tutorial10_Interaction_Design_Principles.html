<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of this long-term tutorial (posted early in the term) is to provide you with an opportunity to recognize, rather than go looking for, good and bad examples of particular Interaction Design Principles used in Web design.</p>
<p>Each week, starting week 3, a new design principle will be added to the course notes section: 11_Interaction_Design_Principles_For_Web_Design.</p>
<p>These are foundational principles that apply to user interaction design for both web sites and other user interfaces. </p>
<p class="red">IMPORTANT: This tutorial is meant to be done as a term long &quot;scavenger hunt&quot;. The goal is to recognize a good and bad example of one of the interaction design principles rather than go actively looking for it. Where would you look anyway?</p>
<p>To get credit for the tutorial you must complete, or make significant progress on, the exercise problems provided and demonstrate your results to the tutorial TA before you leave the tutorial.<br />

<p>To get credit for this tutorial you must produce, and submit to culearn, a .html web page (hopefully styled nicely) that provides the following:</p>
<p>The two principles you have chosen.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks to the two websites that serve as the good and bad examples (These cannot be the ones used in our notes).</p>
<p>Screen captures that illustrate the example so we have a visual clue without having to follow the hyperlink.</p>
<p>Discussion section for each example explaining why you think it is an example of the interaction principle and what makes it a good or bad example. (Use screen captures if it aids the discussion.)</p>
<p>Style your page to be useful and attractive.</p>
